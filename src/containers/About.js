    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Caffey, Inc. has successfully completed over 750 medical imaging projects in its history.
      A healthcare imaging specialty background is a better model for imaging projects in that we work
      with hospital staff to construct the design we create. With 30 years in the industry, we've made
      many corrections and learned trade trends to better suit our design practices.
    </p>
    <p>We have an in-house design department with over 70 years of corporate history dealing with
       Diagnostic Imaging projects across the US as well as Internationally. Within this design group
       we have Mechanical and Electrical Professional Engineers that give us the ability to quickly
       ascertain the needs of the Customer and the Original Equipment Manufacturer(OEM). We have a
       well-experienced staff that are adept at site survey visits to determine the electrical, mechanical,
       structural and spacial layouts required. This is most critical in equipment swap-outs as well as interior
       reconstruction within a healthcare facility.
