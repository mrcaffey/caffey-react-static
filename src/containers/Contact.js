        <h2>Steps to setting up Site Survey with Caffey, Inc.</h2>
        <h3><i>Please read the following carefully:</i></h3>
        <ol>
        <li>Meet with the customer/OEM and establish a Scope of Work.</li>
        <br/>
        <li>Establish working schematic drawings that can be approved for OEM site-specific space.
          This includes OEM discussions, facility investigation and engineering analysis.
        </li>
        <li>Develop costing for Items 1 and 2 with options as necessary.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Once the survey is completed, it then moves to the acceptance period of construction.</p>
      <p>The site survey is flexible in cost and if project is awarded, that cost is normally absorbed by
        the overall construction fee. In some instances, the customer is uncertain as to the level of the site 
        survey regarding inspection and investigation as funding for design/construction is uncertain. Thus, the 
        site survey can range from a minor, descriptive cost to a much more detailed analysis.</p>
